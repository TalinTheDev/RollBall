My first real game!

## Game
Features:
- 3 short, simple, easy levels
- Game start screen
- Game end screen (+ credits)
- Score counter (meaningless)
- No pause menu
- Infinite restarts (to lazy to implement death counter)
- Quick fun
- Short fun
- Finite fun

## Credits
I used Brackeys's [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6) to get started with Unity and I recreated the game he makes in it using his videos as a reference as needed.

Thanks to Brackeys for getting me started!
